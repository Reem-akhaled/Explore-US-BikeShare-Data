# üö≤ Explore US BikeShare Data

_This project is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.
It explores U.S. bike share data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington._

_This project provides insights into how people use bike share systems in major U.S. cities 
through a simple and interactive Python-based analysis tool._

_The program is an interactive command-line application that lets users:_
- Choose a city and filter data by month, day, both, or view all data.
- View raw data in increments of 5 rows upon request.
- Explore key statistics about bike share usage, including:
- Most common travel times (month, day, hour).
- Most popular stations and trip combinations.
- Trip duration statistics (total and average).
- User demographics such as type, gender, and birth year (if available).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

#### üìë Dataset Description

_The datasets used in this project were provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the U.S.
